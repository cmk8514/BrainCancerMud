Recall Square 
At the intersections of Primaria and Primaric Streets, here is a square in the middle of this town, this is where one can ^brecall^? to apparently. It looks like it is made possible by stone gargoyles projecting a ^bcurtain of blue energy^? over this square that are jutting out from the nearby buildings. Speaking of that, it seems the Tungsten Rose bar is to the north, the Academy is to the east, the Morgue and shops are to the west, and the way out of this town is to the south.

We sincerely hope you have no desire to leave Primus or seek employment elsewhere.

The old forests of the Nee Side, trees and shrubs grow here, blotting out some light during the day, vines grow up around the trees and ancient technology fans out, wires touching the trees much like the vines and connecting to old matrix towers that stand not unlike trees.

Road to Rockport 
This road seems to travel a long distance, it stretches as far as the eye can see, made of paving and from the mashed up shells of robotic insects from a long time ago, this blackened road provides a way of travel between the major points of the Nee Side Region. It seems to end to the north, a small port can be seen that way.

Seeing people in ratty clothes in various places at different times, the human and brute nod at each other, and the brute goes on the offensive, stripping the people in poor quality clothes completely naked and being very thorough about it. They are surprised even more though when the human comes by and gives them a wad of cash, a woman, although she conceals her breasts and vulva, her bare ass is still visible to a hidden camera says 'Wait, what?', and the man replies 'You need some new threads, I would head to Lothbari's', and the brute savage gives a grin and nod in agreement. A message then plays 'Get the best clothes and gear around from Lothbari's and you should do it because New Naw Ork, we really don't want to have to send these two gentlemen out again'.

One can walk around them or turn them around with a button to see their bare butts as well as touching them in ways from ruffling their hair or bushes, poking their chests, even manipulating their penises and balls with another button giving them full erections, and more (Although they never react). It's not known if this is some sort of dating system for guys to put themselves out there or a public health program as there is no information for it. However, if one scrolls through long enough, they will reach a naked man's image who turns the whole system an ^rangry red^? and then resets. One thing does stand out about this particular nude dude who is not rude and that is he has two pairs of testicles.

A ^bholographic video ad^? is displayed here, set in the bathing complex of an arcology, several nude men and women are seen walking to the sonic or water showers and a woman with her big but firm looking naked ass facing the camera is off to the side. A nude muscular man steps into the frame and says 'It's fun having a wife with the money my arcology job pays me but I gotta tell you, the 18 hour work days, 7 days a week means I never get to bang her. That's why I got this guy!' A second naked man who looks just like the first man then steps into frame, he might be an identical twin except for the fact his genitalia is not just small in comparison to the first man's, but actually looks atrophied. The first nude man then says 'Every night when he plugs in, he copies my memories of what I do in addition to my work responsibilities being uploaded to me, he doesn't get jealous unlike the previous models...' as the second man nods before he continues by saying 'And I can pass work inspections and tests in my pod!' and then the naked woman turns around and approaches the two, revealing her big boobs and trimmed bush, as she gives both men a peck on the cheek and says 'And we can do whatever we want.' A text box appears and declares 'When the time is right and your salary is high enough, talk to your doctor about getting a B-clone, so they can do the business, while you do the pleasure... Warning, may cause anxiety, depression, a sense of ennui, soul leakage, and involuntary transfer of memories to other nearby B-clones. Regurgex, the drug that stops the B-clone from thinking he is the original and you are the clone as well as stopping penile regeneration is sold separately'.

A street with gold painted objects decorating it. There are several things of interest here. There is a ^ygolden calf^? on the west side of the street here, incense pours out of a large open doorway as barrels of money being moved on dolly carts can be seen as well as half-naked men and women fanning morbidly obese men being fed radgrapes can be seen watching the street through windows. On the east side is the entrance of a tall tower as the word 'BANK' can be seen.

Next scene, he drops a bag of gold and the armor piece on a Psychic's desk and the Psychic nods, in the final scene, our hero is teleported into the cave where the villains meet and opens fire with his blaster as both Raiders and Yndonesian monsters disintegrate into green flames. Agent Chest Ransom holds up the tube with a grin as a voiceover says 'PSYCHOS - THE FRESHENER!'

A ^bholographic ad^? shows a mountaintop scene with a man in a dark hooded robe with a big axe, standing over and about to ritually sacrifice another man... when the man in the hooded robe's robe rings with the cry of a cellphone. He drops his axe and answers the phone and talks on it and walks away from the altar while the other man gets up and flees. Another man on a ridge above, also in a dark robe, just shakes his head. An image of a paper appears showing 'Joe Sacrificer - Fired from 2 previous jobs for incompetence', a voiceover then says 'Background checks are vital for any business, if you are an employer, get them for all new employees today!'
