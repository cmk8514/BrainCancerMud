<P align=center><FONT size=5><STRONG>What is a
MUD?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P align=left>MUD stands for "Multi-User Dungeon", and refers to a text-based
multi-user game centered around a fantasy adventure genre such as Dungeons and
Dragons.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>In a typical MUD, a person would connect to a MUD Server using a
Telnet client (such as windows Telnet) or a MUD client (which is usually just a
fancy telnet program).&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>That person would then create a character.&nbsp; A character is an
adventuring person whose role you would take on whenever you log into the
MUD.&nbsp; A character&nbsp;may be a sword swinging Fighter, a sneaky Thief, a
spell casting Mage, a powerful Cleric, or even a singing Bard.&nbsp; Your
character can also be of many different races, including Elf, Gnome, Dwarf,
Human, Halfling, and sometimes many others.</P>
<P align=left>Once a person has a character in a MUD, they may take that
character on wondrous adventures.&nbsp; A character may explore vast caverns,
fight numerous monsters, uncover fabulous treasures, solve <SPAN

</SPAN>puzzles, and avoid numerous traps.&nbsp; </P>
<P align=left>The object, however, is always the same: to advance the character
in Experience.&nbsp; As a character advances in Experience,&nbsp;he or
she&nbsp;also gains new powers and capabilities, allowing the character to take
on even more difficult monsters and explore more dangerous places, with even
greater reward.</P>
<P align=left><STRONG>A Mud is Text Based</STRONG></P>
<P align=left>In this world of computer games with amazing graphical
capabilities, why would anyone play a text based game?&nbsp; Another question
might be:&nbsp; If we have television, why bother reading books?&nbsp; The
answer is the same.&nbsp; Our imagination still provides greater inspiration
than any high resolution computer game, or any television show can mimic.</P>
<P align=left>MUDs can be extremely well written at times, providing descriptive
places and monsters that interact with you at a level of complexity unmatched in
the best computer game.&nbsp; Also, since your interaction is
through&nbsp;english word&nbsp;commands, your ability to interact with the world
is also greatly enhanced.&nbsp; In fact, interaction can be so complex and
realistic that many people play MUDs just for that social interaction, <SPAN

</SPAN>the greater aim of advancing a character.</P>
<P align=left>In conclusion, it should be pointed out that a MUD can be the most
addictive, rewarding leisure experience of your life, if you give it a
chance.&nbsp; There are also numerous web sites and hundreds if not thousands of
MUDs to play, each with their own special characteristics and twists to enhance
the experience for all concerned.</P>
