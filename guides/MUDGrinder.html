        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also included is a pleasant alternative to the command-line
interface described in the <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's Guide</a>
for creating and maintaining the areas, maps, rooms, monsters, and
items inside your MUD. Instead of typing in commands, you can point and
click to design your maps. Instead of running around with your Archon
to get an idea of how things look, you can just point your eyes at the
map on the screen.</p>
      <h2><a name="install">Installation:</a></h2>
      <p>The MUDGrinder is a built in part of the Administrative Web
Site of the CoffeeMud HTTP Web Server. For more information on this
aspect of CoffeeMud, please refer to the <a href="WebServer.html">Web
Server Guide</a>.
So, if you have successfully installed and started up your CoffeeMud
Server, and the Administrative Web Server has been successfully started
as well, then MUDGrinder is already installed! Good job!</p>
      <p>To access MUDGrinder, simply connect to your Administrative
Web Site (<a href="http://localhost:27777/">http://localhost:27777/</a>)
and log into the MUDGrinder pages using your Archon administrative
account information. If you have no idea what an Archon Administrative
account is, you'll need to start back over again and read the <a
 href="InstallationGuide.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="mother">Not Your Mothers MUDGrinder:</a></h2>
      <p>The MUDGrinder is easy to use, but it is not forgiving, and it
is not for wussies. If you make a mistake, you will probably pay for
it. If you click the wrong button, you will regret it. Be careful
kiddies!</p>
      <h2><a name="use">Using MUDGrinder:</a></h2>
      <p>If you've actually played this game before, and you've read
the <a href="ArchonGuide.html">Archon's Guide</a> and <a
 href="GameBuildersGuide.html">Game Builders Guide</a>
, and you understand it, you will have no troubles at all. The
MUDGrinder is merely a visual means of accomplishing the same tasks,
with the same objects and parameters as are described in the Archon's
Guide.</p>
      <p>If you have any further questions, or want to know how to undo
a mistake, refer to the previous section.</p>
      <h2><a name="notes">Author's Notes:</a></h2>
      <p>Users of previous versions of the MUDGrinder know that the
documentation provided for this version of the editor are twice as good
as anything provided previously. However, the same caveats still apply:
do not email Bo and tell him that his Java and MUD puns are not funny.
He knows they are funny. He also knows you think they are funny and
that any protests to the contrary are vicious lies.</p>
