      <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction to
Random Generation</a></h2>
      <p>Random generation in the realm of mud areas, rooms,
items, mobs, and so forth is a strange proposition. &nbsp;In the
end, it always boils down to selecting among known, fixed, and constant
alternatives that make sense in a particular context. &nbsp;For
example, a mob that might be named "George" or "A path in the forest"
is certainly random, but doesn't make much sense, so we tend to
restrict our alternatives in some way. &nbsp;Also, selecting evenly
among alternatives, while certainly the most common thing you will do,
also sometimes doesn't make sense. &nbsp;A random Moon description
might include words like "full", "new", "crescent", "half", and "BLUE".
&nbsp;However, just because you want the "BLUE" alternative to be
available, doesn't mean you want it to have an equal chance of
describing your moon as the other choices. &nbsp; Lastly, sometimes
the context in which an alternative makes sense can be extremely
narrow. &nbsp;Having "a rat" as a random monster in your dungeon
almost always makes sense, except in the "cat room". &nbsp;Again,
judgement must come into play.</p>
      <p>All of these considerations and more have gone into the
devising of a random mud engine, and particularly to the format of the
input data it uses. &nbsp;This engine receives a series of sets of
alternatives which may include a relative weight for each alternative,
and potentially the context in which each alternative applies or
doesn't apply, and then makes selections and instantiates&nbsp;real
mud objects based on those selections. &nbsp;The input to the
engine is a very specifically built XML file, and the output is actual
mud objects (mobs, items, areas, rooms, or all the above) in your game.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;" /></p>
      <h2><a name="structure">Overview of
XML Tags</a></h2>
      <a name="structure">The random generator works by reading a
specially-written XML document
that contains tags describing the object or objects to generate.
&nbsp;For example, area generation looks for tags named
&lt;AREA /&gt;, mobs for &lt;MOB /&gt;, items for
&lt;ITEM /&gt;, rooms for &lt;ROOM /&gt;, and so forth.
&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
The embedding of tags can&nbsp;also be significant. &nbsp;For
example, to generate a mob from a given &lt;MOB /&gt; tag, the
tag must either contain a NAME attribute, or a &lt;NAME /&gt;
tag embedded inside the &lt;MOB /&gt; tag. &nbsp;Another
example would be that<br />
room tags may contain mob and item tags.<br />
      <br />
Generation sometimes requires that a specific starting object be named
by ID, in which case an ID attribute may be found on the tag, allowing
it to be referenced globally, no matter where it is embedded.<br />
      <br />
The basic&nbsp;tag types are AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, and STRING.
&nbsp;Any tag that contains other tags of the same tag type is a
Container tag, and usually has rules in the form of special attributes
for how to select among the alternatives in the container. &nbsp;In
cases where one of something is called for, but multiple options are
available, and no rules are found for how to select among them, a
random roll will be made. &nbsp;In cases where one or more of
something is allowed, and multiple options are available, all the
alternatives found will be selected.<br />
      <br />
Each basic tag type is used to build an object of that type.&nbsp;
For
instance, the MOB tag is used to build a MOB.&nbsp; Therefore, each
basic
object type must have other tags or attributes to "fill in the
details", such as name, level, and so forth.&nbsp; These Details
may be
defined as variables on the command line using GENERATE or by the
"define" attribute, or may be given as an attribute of the basic tag,
or as other tags inside the parent tag.&nbsp; A Detail given as an
attribute
always supersedes any detail given as internal tags, no matter
what.&nbsp; A
detail found as an defined variable identifier, supersedes both tags and<br />
attributes. &nbsp;See the glossary for more tails on each major tag
type.<br />
      <br />
Basic
tags may also have special pre-defined variables to help give some
context to help with their parsing, and will often cause variables to
be defined as their details are filled in.&nbsp; Basic tags also
have
certain required details which must be resolved for the<br />
object to be created, and other optional details which may or may not
be given, and which are extremely object-specific. &nbsp;Again, the
glossary entry for each basic tag type will have more information about
this.<br />
      <br />
Tags are always evaluated recursively, from first to last.
&nbsp;Any tag may contain zero or more of the following
meta-attributes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

This is similar to "validate" except that "condition" determines
whether a tag is among the allowed choices,&nbsp;whereas "validate"
determines whether, after being chosen, it is finally built into a
final thing (whether string, mob, item, whatever). &nbsp;These
expressions may use boolean operators like AND and OR and NOT (or
!),&nbsp;string constants are always single-quoted 'string', string
comparison&nbsp;operators include = , !=, and IN to check to see if
the lhs string is a&nbsp;substring of the rhs string. Numeric
comparisons may be made as well, and&nbsp; numeric comparison
operators include &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= != =.&nbsp;
Parenthesis may be&nbsp;used to group sub-expressions. Defined
variables may be included, but only&nbsp;if preceded by a $
character. For instance, to check if the variable "bob"&nbsp;is
equal to "bobvalue", you would enter $bob='bobvalue'.&nbsp;
Undefined string&nbsp;ids are treated as ''.&nbsp; Remember
that in XML, a &lt; and &gt; characters can not&nbsp;appear
in attribute values, which is why they must be written as &amp;lt;
and&nbsp;&amp;gt; in your xml.</td>

following:<br />

              <li>"id": either a new or existing identifier, in

identifiers.&nbsp; An identifier whose name starts with "_" will
persist for&nbsp;every tag and object in the room's "room

      <h2><a name="using">Using the Random Generator</a></h2>
There are currently two ways to use the Random Generator, one is the
Archon GENERATE command, and the other is the Area type
"StdAutoGenInstance".<br />

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate Command</span>:<br />
      <br />
The most straightforward way to access the random generator is using
the Archon GENERATE command. &nbsp;The usage is as follows:<br />
      <br />
GENERATE [OBJ TYPE] [ID] (FROM [FILENAME]) ([VAR]=[VAL]...)
([DIRECTION])<br />
      <br />
This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your
mud.&nbsp; This content can&nbsp;be anything from whole areas,
to rooms, mobs, items, or simple strings. By default,
the&nbsp;content is built from the file in
resources/randareas/example.xml, though the builder&nbsp;may
specify his or her own xml file path as one of the many
arguments.&nbsp; The arguments,&nbsp;briefly, are:<br />

variables will cause an error message listing the variables which
must&nbsp;be defined, and the type of data required for the

Variable types which list numbers&nbsp;as their data types may also
have
math expressions values (so you can use random numbers).&nbsp;
See&nbsp;the help

more
"override" values.&nbsp; Many object fields (such as

items, or NAME, etc) as well as the XML id tags, can have their
"random" values overridden&nbsp;by defining them using the generate

The GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts of
dynamic content&nbsp;for your world, though it can never replace
the caring touch of a real, creative builder.&nbsp;
If&nbsp;anyone is interested in writing their own xml content,
please open up the /resources/randareas/example.xml&nbsp;file and

example on how to construct your own.<br />

Area Type</span>:<br />

The StdAutoGenInstance area type is specially formulated to replace any
rooms of its own with auto-generated rooms and content. &nbsp;<br />
      <br />
This area type is, firstly, an Instance generator. &nbsp;That means
that each group that goes into the area will have their own unique
generated rooms to play in, which will be different from any other
groups, and will persist until the group gets tired of playing it
(causing the area to time-out and be garbage collected).<br />
      <br />
This area type also permits the path and name of the top-level random
generation xml file to be specified, where the /resource directory is
considered the default path root.<br />

Lastly, any required or optional variables. Many tags will have a
specific set of required&nbsp;variables which must be defined in
order for
the content to be generated.&nbsp; Failing to specify&nbsp;one
of the required
variables will cause the area generation to fail, putting an error
message in your mud.log file. &nbsp;Variable types which list
numbers&nbsp;as their data types may also have
math expressions values (so you can use random numbers).&nbsp;
See&nbsp;the help
on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.&nbsp; In addition
to
required variables, you&nbsp;may also use the space to enter one or
more
"override" values for existing defined things.
      <h2><a name="glossary">Glossary of XML Tags</a></h2>
      <p><a name="areatag"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AREA tags</span></a>:
      <br />
As the highest-level possible tag, an area is parsed only with the
variables it is given on the GENERATE command line, and using whatever
it can find in its XML contents for its details.&nbsp; All details
mentioned below will
automatically cause a variable to be defined or re-defined when they
are parsed.&nbsp;
The variable will be called "AREA_DETAILNAME".&nbsp; For instance
"AREA_CLASS" for
class, and "AREA_NAME" for name.<br />
      <br />
The layout of an area will cause its rooms to be logically grouped up
into streets, "leaf" rooms (rooms with only one exist), and other
logical
groupings.&nbsp; "leaf" rooms are always done first, followed by
streets, and others.&nbsp; The
layout will automatically define certain variables for each room to
help with parsing the rooms
details.&nbsp; These variables include:<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>$AREA_NUMLEAFS: the number of leaf rooms for the whole area</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODETYPE: one of surround, leaf, offleaf, street,
square,
interior</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODERUN: for streets, which way they run.&nbsp;
Values are
ns, ew, nwse, nesw</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEFLAGS: various rooms flags. Values include:
corner, gate,
intersection, tee, offleaf </li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEEXITS: comma separated list of all exits from
a room</li>
        <li>$ROOMTAG_NODEGATEEXIT: if this room is a "gate" rooms,
which direction
is the gate in.</li>
        <li>$ROOMLINK_N, $ROOMLINK_S, $ROOMLINK_E, $ROOMLINK_W, etc:
"true" if an exit
exists that way.</li>
        <li>$ROOMTITLE_N, $ROOMTITLE_S, $ROOMTITLE_E, $ROOMTITLE_W,
etc: if already
done, the title of a room that way.</li>
        <li>$NODETYPE_N, $NODETYPE_S, $NODETYPE_E, $NODETYPE_W, etc:
type of room node
in that direction, if any.</li>
      </ul>
